# Lutils

A collection of utilities and libraries for Lua by Lua.
Some of these are experimental, and none of them have a guarantee of safety.
Currently a number of these have been made for use with [redbean](https://redbean.dev/), which may cause problems when using one of these files with a standard Lua runtime.
