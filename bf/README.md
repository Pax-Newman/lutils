# Brainfuck.lua

This is a small interpreter for the [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
programming language, largely started so I could practice building interpreters.

Currently this implementation has a REPL for running bf code and seeing the results of it.
Future plans are to introduce optimizations to the interpreter and allow for running bf programs from a file.
